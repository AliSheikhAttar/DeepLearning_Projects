# DeepLearning_Projects
Couple of Deep learning practices that i done during a DeepLearning Cource that i participated<br />
including : pandas, numpy, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, Ann, Cnn, Convolution and ...<br/>
## Part One : Python_Basics<br/>
- some basics of python and functions<br/>
## Part Two : Numpy_Basics<br/>
- utilize numpy tools with arrays<br/>
- using numpy<br/>
## Part Three : Simple_ANN<br/>
- predicting sinus function by modeling it with ANN<br/>
- using numpy, pandas, keras, Sequential and sklearn<br/>
## Part Four : ANN_Vs_CNN<br/>
- image processing and predicting images on CIFAR Dataset by ANN and CNN and compare them .<br/>
- using tensorflow, keras, Sequential, matplotlib and Conv2D<br/>
## Part Five : CNN_Classification
- image processing and Classification on Cat and dog pictures on CatVsDog dataset on kaggle .<br/>
- using tensorflow, keras, Sequential, matplotlib, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten and Dropout<br/>
## Part Six : RNN_Word_Embedding
- obtain embedding for words using famous embeddings, GLove and Word2Vec and find relation and similarities between words by cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.<br/>
- using numpy, axel, Glove, sklearn, sklearn.metrics, cosine_similarity and cosine_distances<br/>
## Part Seven : RNN_Sentiment_Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks on [imdb 50k movie reviews dataset on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).<br/>
- using numpy, pandas, kaggle, csv, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, Sequential, Embedding, Dense and LSTM<br/>
## Part Eight : Pytorch
- function prediction by modeling it's neural network with pytorch and work with MNIST dataset using pytorch.<br/>
- using matplotlib, torch, nn, matplotlib, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten and Dropout<br/>
